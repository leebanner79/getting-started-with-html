    The web is mainly made up of <b>HTML</b> documents.<br>
This stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em><br>
<b>HTML</b> is the language which tells a computer how something should look!
<p><b>HTML</b> uses lots of different <b>tags</b> to make text content appear in a certain way.<br>
For example the word bold with no tag looks like any other word until a <b>bold</b> tag is used.</b><br>
This is what a bold tag looks like <img src="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tag.gif" alt="bold tag picture"><br>
<em>Other examples of HTML can be found at <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools"</a></em>
</p>
<p>When someone wants to access the web they do so through a <b>browser</b> such as google chrome.  A broweser converts the <b>HTML</b> into what we can see on the computer screen.<br>
  The <b>HTML</b> files are sent from servers via the internet using a protocol called <b>HTTP</b><br>
  A server is just a computer like you have at home but normally kept in a datacentre
